    <h1 class="head" align="center"> Poet SRISRI </h1>
    <p class="para1">
        Srirangam Srinivasa Rao was the first true modern Telugu poet to write about contemporary issues that affected the day-to-day 
        life of a common man in a style and metre which were not used in classical Telugu poetry. He moved poetry forward from traditional mythological
         themes to reflect more contemporary issues. The essence of his personality was captured by Gudipati Venkatachalam when he compared him with the great
          romantic Telugu poet Devulapalli Krishnasastri: “While Krishna Sastry made his anguish known to the whole world, Sri Sri spoke in his voice about the
           anguish of the whole world. Krishna Sastry's pain was the pain of the world, while the world's pain became Sri Sri's pain.” </p>
           <p class="para2" >
            Book Maha Prasthanam (The Great Journey), an anthology of poems, is one of his major works.
            In one of the poems, "Jagannathuni Ratha Chakralu", Sri Sri addressed those who were suffering due to social injustices and said, "Don't cry, don't cry. The wheels of the chariot of Jagannath are coming; they are coming!
The apocalyptic chant of the chariot wheels! Come, realize your dreams Rule your new world!". "Other major works include Siprali and Khadga Srushti ("Creation of the Sword"). </p>
